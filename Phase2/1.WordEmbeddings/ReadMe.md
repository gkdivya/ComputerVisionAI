### Sentiment Analysis using Glove Embeddings

This assignment contains the second code sample found in Chapter 6 mentioned on pages: 182-195, Section 1 of [Deep Learning with Python](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/yury/AAI/Textbook/Deep%20Learning%20with%20Python.pdf).

[Github Code Link](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/blob/master/6.1-using-word-embeddings.ipynb)

In the original code, 200 training samples are considered. 

#### With 200 training samples
Validation Accuracy: 70%
Test Data Accuracy: 71.45%

#### With 8000 training samples 
Validation Accuracy: 70%
Test Data Accuracy: 71.45%

#### Without pretrained embeddings
Validation Accuracy: 70%
Test Data Accuracy: 71.45%
