# ENDGAME

## Problem statement:
To train an autonomous car to drive in roads, avoid sand using reinforcement learning.

## Solution:
Earier we have used a DQN approach to solve the problem. Where we have taken the sensors input to train the network.

For EndGame, we are tweaking the above solution by using Convolution networks and state of art TD3 to improve the performance.
